# sticky-projects
The final group project in the course Client-Server Communication.

Post-its have, for a long time, proven to be an excellent way to get a good grasp of any general concept. The platform Sticky Projects follows this concept through into a digital environment. In order to get a simplified and flexible view of future projects, a creator of deliverables can make a new note of an expected project, update it or scrap it and even move them around on the screen to create an order completely up to their own personal logic â€“ just like Post-its on a wall.

This platform will be used to organize projects. After creating an account, the user can create new projects and enter information about them, including title, description, client name, and when the project is expected to be finished. Projects made by the user will appear on the dashboard. On the dashboard, the user can select a project to view information about that specific project, update project details, or delete the project entirely. The user can also view information about their own account, which also allows them to make changes or delete it.
